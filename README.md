# Econometrics Python
This is a sample of my UC Berkeley Econometrics work in where I ran multiple regressions to predict, analyze, and interpret data. In this project I worked with different data sets such as gas prices to create plots and run regressional statistics analysis. This was done with Python for the most difficult Economics course at UC Berkeley.
